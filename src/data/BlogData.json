    "content": "I saw an object gleaming in the sun,\nI went to pick it up just for fun.\nI stood there transfixed ; it looked like a gold ring,\nTo go to the jeweller would be the right thing.\nI went back to my house jumping and hopping ;\nThinking of the money I would get when I sell this ring.\nI sat there dreaming , about what I would do with the money ;\nI dreamt of eating cakes , biscuits , and honey.\nI went to the jeweller and showed him the ring,\nHe took it as a joke , well worth laughing.\nI glared at him , as anger came upon me,\nBut he stared back and said , placing his hand upon his knee.\n“I would give that ring not even a single cent!”\nWatching my face full of utter disappointment.\nFuming , I stood up and walked out of his shop,\nAnd I ran and ran and ran onto a cliff with a steep drop.\nI fell and fell and fell , out of my bed and onto the floor,\nI was in my room , my back sore.",
