    "content": "I saw an object gleaming in the sun,\nI went to pick it up just for fun.\nI stood there transfixed ; it looked like a gold ring,\nTo go to the jeweller would be the right thing.\nI went back to my house jumping and hopping ;\nThinking of the money I would get when I sell this ring.\nI sat there dreaming , about what I would do with the money ;\nI dreamt of eating cakes , biscuits , and honey.\nI went to the jeweller and showed him the ring,\nHe took it as a joke , well worth laughing.\nI glared at him , as anger came upon me,\nBut he stared back and said , placing his hand upon his knee.\n“I would give that ring not even a single cent!”\nWatching my face full of utter disappointment.\nFuming , I stood up and walked out of his shop,\nAnd I ran and ran and ran onto a cliff with a steep drop.\nI fell and fell and fell , out of my bed and onto the floor,\nI was in my room , my back sore.",

    "title": "Time",
    "content": "What is Time? According to Physicists, it’s a dimension. Plato defines it as the moving image of eternity. Einstein determined that time is relative. If you ask a passerby, they might look at their watch and tell you a bunch of numbers. So, what is time?<br>&emsp;It’s hard to put it into words. We can’t see time. Time has its effect on everything. From the germination of a seed to the supernova thousands of light years away. Everything is time. If time ceased, there would be an absolute nothingness. There would be no reason, no purpose, no existence. Time is the fabric that weaves the tapestry of our reality, the invisible thread that binds all events and experiences together.<br>&emsp;Time is omnipresent, time is omniscient, time is the silent witness to every birth and death, every triumph, every tragedy, every moment of joy, sorrow, anger, hope, and every moment of despair.<br>&emsp;There’s no escaping time. Our very existence is tied to time. From the watches on our wrist, to the wrinkles on our skin. Time is our greatest ally, but also our most formidable foe. Time provides us growth and progress, but it also gives us death and endings.<br>&emsp;Yet, even after thousands of years of human civilization, time remains an enigma. We can’t stop it, we can’t rewind it. We can only go with the flow of time. It speeds up when we want it to slow down, and crawls when we wish for it to fly. We can measure it with pinpoint precision, yet can never control.<br>&emsp;Time might not just be a dimension or a mere concept. It could be a fundamental aspect of consciousness itself, the portal through which we perceive change in the world. Perhaps time is the ultimate mystery humankind has ever faced—a question so profound that its answer could redefine the universe as we know it.",
